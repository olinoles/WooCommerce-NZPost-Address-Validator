<h2>Description:</h2>  

A simple JS script I wrote for adding address validation to the WooCommerce checkout.  
<h2>Compatibility:</h2>  

Tested up to WooCommerce version 4.8.0.   

<h2>Use:</h2>  

Replace the placeholder text in Line 5 with your authentication page URL.  
You will need access to the NZ Post API to do this.
