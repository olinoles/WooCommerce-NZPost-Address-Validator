<h2>Description:</h2>  

A simple JS script I wrote for adding address validation to the WooCommerce checkout.  
It uses the NZ Post parcel address API to validate user input on the address field at the WooCommerce checkout. You will need to obtain permission from NZ post to use their API first. [Info located here](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/nz-post-group/b8271f09-2ad8-4e1c-b6b1-322c5727d148/parceladdress-api/)

You can also use [this PHP script](https://github.com/olinoles/Retrieve-NZ-Post-API-Token) to generate your API token.
<h2>Compatibility:</h2>  

Tested up to WooCommerce version 4.8.0.   

<h2>Use:</h2>  

Replace the placeholder text in Line 5 with your authentication page URL.  
You will need access to the NZ Post API to do this.
